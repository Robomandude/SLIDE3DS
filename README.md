# SLIDE3DS
Some Lua Integrated Development Environment for 3DS

a functional text editor!  missing file loading and saving though -.-
	i plan on adding an image editor,and a lua 3dsx compiler(copy lpp.3dsx to new folder and place requesite files in)
[A] is currently shift and enter simultaniously
[B] is crash() (for faster testing in citra
[X] is backspace
[Y] is delete
Dpad is for moving the cursor
touch a key to highlight it, release to select highlighted key
the first two empty keys are space.  the third one is tab. (i will change this later to something more obvious)
